This is the README file for the Google Homepage project on TOP. I designed this version
of the Google homepage using a dark theme, based off of the colors used while viewing
Google with the Dark Reader extension turned on.

My finished project URL will be entered here: https://thatblindgeye.github.io/google-homepage/
